 Used Naive Bayes Classification(for better Accuracy) –

This is the Probabilistic Machine Learning Algorithm based on the Bayes theorem. Formulae- P(A|B) = ( P(B|A) P(A) ) / P(B) P(A|B) – Likelihood of occurrence of A, P(B|A) – Likelihood of occurrence of B, P(A) – probability of Occurrence of A, P(B) – probability of Occurrence of B.

To run this model, you need to be installed with python and its path setup with cmd I had attached the requirements.txt files which contains all libraries need to be install to run the model successfully. You have to go to this "Loan-Prediction-Model-Using-Python" folder on cmd if you are downloading zip file. then, type cmd " pip install requirements.txt " - This will install all libraries into the Python, If you are using Pycharm, then, you have to install the libraries manually from 'file->settings' menu in pycharm which I am specifying below.

Python Libraries used in this Project –
Pandas-

pip install pandas
NumPy-

 pip install numpy
Matplotlib-

 pip install matplotlib
Scikit-learn-

pip install scikit-learn
If there occurs the error of PREMISSION or any user access is needed while installing libraries - then use this command

	pip install library_name --user
